"""benign_signals — features that separate a benign pass-through pooler / legit business
from a laundering collector, which look identical under peer/flow/network alone.

Three families (design's benign traits), each a direction+strength vs a 0.5 midpoint:
  retention  : share of inflow RETAINED in-window (1 - flow_through). High => keeps funds.
  recurrence : share of inbound that is with REPEAT counterparties. High => stable clientele.
  stability  : spread of activity over time. High => steady operation, not a burst.

Rings show all three LOW (fresh mules, funds forwarded, bursty); poolers/businesses show
them HIGH. The suspicious hypothesis expects them low; benign hypotheses expect them high,
so the duel now SUBTRACTS on real poolers.
