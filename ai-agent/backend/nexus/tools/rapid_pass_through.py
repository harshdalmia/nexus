"""rapid_pass_through — did money arrive and leave quickly?

ratio = (outbound value leaving within `window_hours` of the inflow window) / (total inflow).
High ratio => funds pass straight through (a mule/collector), which supports the suspicious
theory and contradicts "legitimate business that keeps its money". Emits `flow_through`.
