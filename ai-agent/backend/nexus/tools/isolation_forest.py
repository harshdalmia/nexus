"""isolation_forest — the generic-AI anomaly detector as a proof-carrying evidence family.

Emits a NEUTRAL `anomaly` record: it is deliberately NOT in any hypothesis fingerprint or
the risk weights, so it never changes the verdict or the locked anchors. It documents what a
black-box model thought — strengthening the explainability story ("the ML said 0.82, and
here is why NEXUS still concluded benign").
