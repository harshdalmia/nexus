"""Candidate_Screener — the cheap first stage of the broad-query funnel.

Before this module, a broad query like "flag high-risk customers" investigated exactly ONE
account (the highest in_degree) and returned one case. Investigating every account is not an
option: each full investigation costs several DuckDB round-trips against ~5M rows.

So: rank all accounts in memory (measured ~137 ms over 515k rows, zero database queries),
keep a bounded pool, and spend the expensive explainable stage only on the top of it.

Honest positioning: on AMLworld, `in_degree` alone is near-optimal BY CONSTRUCTION, because
the ground truth labels rings by fan-in topology (see README, "Evaluation and honest limits").
This composite is
therefore NOT a precision claim. It is a recall funnel — its only job is to put real hubs
inside the investigation cap. in_degree keeps half the weight so the order stays close to
that near-optimal order; velocity and io_ratio give a small lift to accounts that consolidate
fast or retain nothing without having extreme degree.

Deterministic, feature-only, label-free. No LLM, no ground truth, no database.
