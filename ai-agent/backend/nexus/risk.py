"""Risk Engine — severity of the winning suspicious story, as a transparent sum.

risk = Σ (family_weight × family_strength) over independent families, ×100  -> 0..100.
Only suspicious-direction ("high") evidence contributes, so when a benign theory wins
(flow_through low, peer low, ...) there is little to sum and risk stays low — the duel
gates the risk.

Because risk is additive, counterfactuals ("what if we drop this family?") are just the
same sum with a family zeroed out.
