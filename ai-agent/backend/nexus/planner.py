"""Planner: choose which tools run for a spec, and record which are skipped and why.

This is the visible proof of a per-query plan (not a fixed pipeline). Selection is derived
from THREE spec inputs only — `intent`, `typology`, and whether the query named an entity —
so the same spec always yields the same plan, and two different query shapes yield visibly
different plans.

Locked-anchor guarantee: the SCORING tool set for each existing typology route is exactly
what it was before this module grew (smurfing -> peer/pass-through/motif/benign;
structuring -> peer/near-threshold). The nodes added here (`eda_profile`, `feature_builder`,
`candidate_screener`, `isolation_forest`) emit only NEUTRAL families, so they cannot move a
score no matter when they run.
